SBFW - The Simple Business Framework
====================================

If you like ATK Framework's easy for creating rich CRUD interfaces but have stumbled
into its issues the  this framework is for you.

I have two inspirations: Zend Framework and ATK Framework.

The goal is to build a framework that has all benefits of ATK and al the "modern"
patterns of ZF (have you ever looked at ATK's code?).

Contrary to ZF this is not a component framework though they might be individual
classes that could be used stand-alone.

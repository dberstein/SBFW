SBFW - The Simple Business Framework
====================================

If you like [ATK Framework's](http://www.atk-framework.com/) easy for creating rich CRUD interfaces but have stumbled
into its issues the  this framework is for you.

I have two inspirations: [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) and [ATK Framework](http://www.atk-framework.com/).

The goal is to build a framework that has all benefits of ATK and al the "modern"
patterns of [ZF](http://framework.zend.com/) (have you ever looked at [ATK's](http://www.atk-framework.com/) code?).

Contrary to [ZF](http://framework.zend.com/) this is not a component framework though they might be individual
classes that could be used stand-alone.
